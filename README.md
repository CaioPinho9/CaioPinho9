# 👋 Hello there, I'm Caio by the way.

Welcome to my GitHub, where may or not have some nice stuff. I'm a Systems of Information student at [UFSC](https://ufsc.br/).

## 🎓 Academic Journey

📚 Currently surviving studying at UFSC, where I've mastered the art of making a thousand assignments at the same week.

## 💻 Tech Toolbox

🚀 Switching from Python backend to Java because why not complicate? Also Python is kinda weird.

## ⚙️ Physics Engine Project

🎮 I was bored and wanted to do something new, so why not recreate something that already exists but my way ~~worse~~

### Project Goals

- Pretending to understand 2d object physics. ~~maybe 3d but I dont know~~ 
- Use OpenGL to create the render of the project.
- Creating a physics engine that works (optional).
