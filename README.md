I was bored and wanted to do something new, so why not recreate something that already exists but my way ~~worse~~. My own physics engine.

### Project Goals

- Pretending to understand 2d object physics. ~~maybe 3d but I dont know~~ 
- Utilizing OpenGL for rendering.
- Creating a physics engine that works.
- Expand it into a game engine.
